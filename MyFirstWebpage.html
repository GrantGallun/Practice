            Hi how are you
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>

            <p>This is also a paragraph</p>

            <h1>This however is a heading</h1>
            <h2>This however is a heading</h2>
            <h3>This however is a heading</h3>
            <h4>This however is a heading</h4>
            <h5>This however is a heading</h5>
            <h6>This however is a heading</h6>

            <strong>Doesn't look very bold to me</strong>

            <p><strong>That</strong> looks a little more bold</p>
            <em>Who thought to call this em</em>
            <p>I feel like the creator of <em>em</em> did not put much thought into naming</p>
            <p>All the above text are siblings to each other</p>
